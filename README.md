I'm a enterprise architect from Brazil experienced mainly with distributed systems, clean code, scalable applications and process automation.

In my spare time, I work with some open-source projects, such as [Add Username Top Panel extension](https://github.com/brendaw/add-username-toppanel) for GNOME.

If you like some of my work and want to reward me somehow, you can warm my heart simply by saying "thank you" or by becoming my sponsor :)
